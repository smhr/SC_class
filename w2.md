## Controlling version

### git

* git is a distributed version control system.
* When you clone a repository you get all the history too.
* All stored in .git subdirectory of top directory.

--
* `git commit` commits to your clone’s .git directory.

--
* `git push` sends your recent changesets to another clone
by default: the one you cloned from (e.g. bitbucket).

--
* `git fetch` pulls changesets from another clone
by default: the one you cloned from (e.g. bitbucket).

--
* `git merge` applies changesets to your working copy

### Advantages of distributed model

* You can commit changes, revert to earlier versions,
examine history, etc. without being connected to server.

--
* Also without affecting anyone else’s version if you’re
working collaboratively.

--
* No problem if server dies, every clone has full history.

--
* For collaboration will still need to push or fetch changes
eventually and **git merge** may become more complicated.

### some useful tools

* `sudo apt-get gitk` (revision tree visualizer)
* `sudo apt-get meld` (graphical tool to diff and merge files)

### Example



## Modern FORTRAN

### Compiled vs. interpreted language

* interpreter: e.g. Python, Matlab, Mathematica, Octave, ...

    * Takes commands one at a time, converts into machine code, and executes.
    * Allows interactive programming at a shell prompt.
    * Can’t take advantage of optimizing over a entire program — does not know what instructions are coming next.
    * Must translate each command while running the code, possibly many times over in a loop.
    
--
    
* Compiled: e.g. Fortran, c, c++
    
    * The program must be written in 1 or more files (source code).
    * These files are input data for the compiler, which is a computer program that analyzes the source code and converts it into object code.
    

* **Why two steps?**

### Fortran history

* Prior to Fortran, programs were often written in machine code or assembly language.

--
* Fortran I: 1954–57, followed by Fortran II, III, IV, Fortran 66.

--
* Major changes in **Fortran 77**, which is still widely used.

--
* Major changes again from Fortran 77 to Fortran 90 (array, generic and modular programming).

--
* Fortran 95: minor changes (high performance computing).

--
* Fortran 2003 (object oriented), 2008 (concurrent).Not fully implemented by most compilers.

### Fortran compilers

* GNU fortran, intel fortran, Absoft, NAG, ...

### Fortran syntax

* Big differences between Fortran 77 and Fortran 90/95.
* Fortran 77 still widely used:
    * Legacy codes (written long ago, millions of lines...)
    * Faster for some things.
    
--

* One big difference: Fortran 77 (and prior versions) required fixed format of lines:
* Executable statements must start in column 7 or greater, only the first 72 columns are used, the rest ignored!

--

* Fortran > 77, free format
* Indentation is optional **but** highly recommended.

* Fixed format: .f
* Free format: .f90

### Fortran syntax

```fortran
program example1

    implicit none
    real (kind=8) :: x,y,z

    x = 3.d0
    y = 2.d-1
    z = x + y
    print *, "z = ", z

end program example1
```
--

### Compiling and running Fortran

* Suppose example1.f90 contains this program.

``gfortran example.f90``

compiles and links and creates an executable named a.out

--

* Can give executable a different name with -o flag:

``gfortran example1.f90 -o example1.exe``

--

* Can separate compile and link steps:

``gfortran -c example1.f90`` creates example1.o

``gfortran example1.o -o example1.exe``

### Fortran arrays

### Fortran functions and subroutines

For now, assume we have a single file filename.f90 that
contains the main program and also any functions or
subroutines needed.

--
* Functions take some input arguments and return a single value.
* Usage: ``y = f(x)`` or ``z = g(x,y)``
* Should be declared as external with the type of value returned:

```fortran
program fcn1
    implicit none
    real(kind=8) :: y,z
    real(kind=8), external :: f

    y = 2.
    z = f(y)
    print *, "z = ",z
end program fcn1

real(kind=8) function f(x)
    implicit none
    real(kind=8), intent(in) :: x
    f = x**2
end function f
```

* ``intent`` specifies intent of each argument.
